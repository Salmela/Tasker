Why new json library?
=====================

I couldn't find any json library that would fit my needs.

The following list were my *must have*s:
 * Parser
   * Fast parsing
   * Tiny memory footprint
   * No DOM
   * Storing the data to actual c++ classes with help of application code
   * Nice error reporting automatically
 * Writer
   * Pretty printing
   * Tiny memory footprint
 * Both
   * Unicode support (UTF8)
   * Remembering foreign keys (allows forward compatibility)
   * No dependencies to external libraries
   * Small library
   * Simple api
